# AI-Bot

Welcome to my AI Bot project! This is a Python bot that talks to youâ€”basically, you type stuff and it tries to respond like a (pretty basic) AI.

## What is this?

- It's an AI chatbot made for fun and learning.
- I built it as a uni project, so don't expect super advanced stuff.
- You can ask it questions or just chat. Sometimes it's smart. Sometimes... not so much.

## How to use

1. Clone the repo:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Matthew-Tian5/AI-Bot.git
    ```

2. Run it with Python:
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```

3. Start typing messages and see what happens!

## What you need

- Python 3 (literally any recent version should work)
- Claude3 API key (you can get this through their website)
- Maybe some basic Python packages (check the code if you get errors)

## Currrently implementing the project on AWS through Docker (IN PROGRESS)
